# Best Practices

## Code Organization

- **Separate files by functionality**: Keep different concerns in separate files
- **Use ES6 modules**: Import and export functionality between files
- **Keep functions small**: Each function should do one thing well

## Code Quality

- **Run linting regularly**: Use `npm run lint` to catch errors
- **Format your code**: Use `npm run format` for consistent styling
- **Use meaningful variable names**: `userName` instead of `u` or `data`

## Development Workflow

1. Write your code in the `src/` directory
2. Test locally with `npm start`
3. Lint and format before committing: `npm run lint:fix && npm run format`
4. Build for production with `npm run build`

## File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js      # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html    # HTML template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css     # Global styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/      # Additional modules (create as needed)
```

## Tips

- Keep `index.js` simple - it should primarily import other modules
- Use CSS classes instead of inline styles
- Comment complex logic
- Test your production build before deploying

* **What to do:**
    * **Variables and Functions:** Use names that clearly explain what they do or what they hold.
        * Good: `cityName`, `fetchWeatherData`, `updateDisplay`
        * Bad: `x`, `getData`, `update`
    * **Files:** Name your files based on what they contain.
        * Good: `api.js`, `weatherDisplay.js`, `utils.js`
        * Bad: `stuff.js`, `main.js` (if it's not the actual main entry)
    * **Consistency is Key:**
        * `camelCase` for variables and functions (`myAwesomeFunction`).
        * `PascalCase` for classes (if you use them, `WeatherApp`).
        * `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for things that never change (constants, like `API_KEY`).
        * `kebab-case` for CSS classes, HTML IDs, and file names (`weather-card`, `city-input`).

* **Why it helps:**
    * **Readability:** Your code is much easier to understand quickly.
    * **Collaboration:** Others (and your future self!) will thank you.

## 4. üíæ Save Your Progress (Git & GitHub)

Think of Git as a super-powered "save" button for your project, and GitHub as a cloud backup and sharing platform.

* **What to do:**
    * **Small, Frequent Saves (Commits):** After you finish a small task or add a new feature, "save" it with Git.
        * `git add .` (Stage all changes)
        * `git commit -m "feat: Add city input field"` (Save with a clear message)
    * **Good Commit Messages:** Your commit message should explain *what* you changed and *why*. Start with a type like `feat:` (new feature), `fix:` (bug fix), `refactor:` (code cleanup), `docs:` (documentation change).
    * **Push to GitHub Often:** After committing, send your changes to GitHub (`git push origin main`). This backs up your work and makes it available to others.

* **Why it helps:**
    * **Safety Net:** You can always go back to an older version of your code if you make a mistake.
    * **Tracking Changes:** You have a history of everything you've done.
    * **Teamwork:** Makes it easy to work with others on the same project.

## 5. üîë Handle Secrets (Like API Keys) Carefully

Imagine your house key. You wouldn't leave it under the doormat for everyone to find, right? API keys are like keys to special services.

* **What to do:**
    * **NEVER put API keys directly in your client-side JavaScript code** (the code that runs in the user's browser). Anyone can see it!
    * For learning projects with public APIs (like OpenWeatherMap's free tier), sometimes you have to expose the key, but be aware of the risk.
    * **Best way (for real apps):** If you ever build a project with a backend (a server), you'd store API keys there and have your server fetch the data, then send it to your frontend. This keeps the key hidden.

* **Why it helps:**
    * **Security:** Protects your accounts and prevents misuse of services.
    * **Prevents Abuse:** Stops others from using your API key and potentially exceeding your usage limits.

## 6. üö® Handle Errors Gracefully

Imagine a website that just stops working or shows a blank screen when something goes wrong. That's frustrating! Good apps tell you what happened.

* **What to do:**
    * **Use `try...catch` for API calls:** When you fetch data from an API, always wrap it in a `try...catch` block. This lets you "catch" problems (like no internet, wrong city name, API server down).
    * **Show User-Friendly Messages:** Instead of crashing, display a message like "City not found," "Network error, please try again," or "Something went wrong."
    * **Log Errors:** Use `console.error()` to log detailed error information in the browser's developer console. This helps you debug.

* **Why it helps:**
    * **Better User Experience:** Users understand what's happening and don't get stuck.
    * **Easier Debugging:** You get clear information about what went wrong.

## 7. ‚ö° Think About Performance

Imagine a slow, clunky app. No one likes that! Fast apps are smooth and enjoyable to use.

* **What to do:**
    * **Only Fetch Data When Needed:** Don't constantly ask the weather API for updates. Only fetch when the user requests it (e.g., clicks a button).
    * **Efficiently Update the Screen:** When you change many things on the screen, try to do it in one go if possible, rather than many tiny changes.
    * **Responsive Design:** Use flexible CSS (like Tailwind's utility classes) so your app looks good on phones, tablets, and computers.

* **Why it helps:**
    * **Faster Loading:** Users get to see your app quickly.
    * **Smooth Experience:** The app feels snappy and responsive.
    * **Saves Resources:** Less data usage for users, less load on servers.

## 8. üìù Document Your Code

Imagine reading a user manual that's missing half its pages. Confusing, right? Good documentation helps everyone.

* **What to do:**
    * **`README.md`:** Keep your main `README.md` file updated with how to run, build, lint, and format your project.
    * **Inline Comments:** Add comments in your JavaScript code to explain complex logic, tricky parts, or why you did something a certain way. Don't comment on *what* the code does if it's obvious, but *why* it does it.
    * **This `BEST_PRACTICES.md` file:** Keep it in your template!

* **Why it helps:**
    * **Clarity:** Helps you remember your own code.
    * **Teamwork:** Makes it easy for others to understand and contribute.
    * **Learning:** Forces you to think clearly about your code.
